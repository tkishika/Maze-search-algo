# 🧭 Maze Search Algorith

This project solves mazes using different search algorithms and compares their performance. It supports both single-goal and multi-goal pathfinding.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search (with Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics)

## 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
python SearchMaze.py
python SearchOptimal.py
